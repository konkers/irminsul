# Thanks

Irmunsil is built upon the work of many others.

- [PJK136](https://github.com/PJK136) whose work on a [fork of `stardb-exporter`](https://github.com/PJK136/stardb-exporter) provided the main inspiration for Irminsul's development.
- [juliuskreutz](https://github.com/juliuskreutz) whose [`stardb-exporter`](https://github.com/juliuskreutz/stardb-exporter) provided the foundation for PJK136's work as well as providing some examples for how to wrangle [`egui`](https://github.com/emilk/egui).
- [hashblen](https://github.com/hashblen) whose [`auto-artifactarioum`](https://github.com/hashblen/auto-artifactarium) is used to interpret the network packets from Genshin.
- [IceDynamix](https://github.com/IceDynamix/) whose work on Honkai Star Rail network scanning is at the root of many of the Genshin and HSR network scanning utilities.
- [emmachase](https://github.com/emmachase) who wrote the packet capture library [`pktmon`](https://github.com/emmachase/pktmon) which Irminsul uses to allow packet capture without having to install a npcap driver as well as their contributions to some of the above projects.
- [Genshin Optimizer](https://frzyc.github.io/genshin-optimizer/) without which there would be no point in exporting data.
- [Inventory Kamera](https://github.com/Andrewthe13th/Inventory_Kamera) which was my introduction into artifact and character scanning and whose discord provided a collaboration environment that spawned Irminsul.
